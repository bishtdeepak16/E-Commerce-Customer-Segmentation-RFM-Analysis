## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer retention, revenue stability, and business growth strategy** for an e-commerce company.  
Using **SQL for data modeling & analytics** and **Power BI for visualization**, uncovering key retention issues, customer value insights, and actionable strategies to reduce churn and broaden the revenue base.

## Business Motivation  
Despite generating **â‚¹123M+ revenue**, the business faced critical issues:  
- **41% lost customers (RFM analysis)**  
- **Q4 retention rate of 31.69%** (slightly below industry benchmarks of 35â€“40%)  
- **High dependency on top 20% customers contributing 55% of revenue**  

**Goal:** Identify why customers churn, find revenue concentration risks, and design actionable retention & acquisition strategies.

## Tech Stack  
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, RFM segmentation, Cohort analysis, CLV calculation  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards for executive summary, segmentation, retention trends, and strategic insights  
- **Data:** e-commerce dataset (customers, transactions)

---

## SQL Key Highlights  
- **RFM Segmentation:** Tagged customers as `Lost`, `At Risk`, `Champions`, `Potential Loyalists`, etc.  
- **CLV Calculation:** Segmented customers into `High`, `Medium`, and `Low CLV`  
- **Pareto Analysis:** Measured revenue dependency on top 20% customers  
- **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked customer retention for 3 months after first purchase
