# E-Commerce Customer Insights & Retention Strategy  
**SQL + Power BI + Cohort Analysis + RFM Segmentation + CLV Analysis**

---

## 1. Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer retention, revenue stability, and business growth strategy** for an e-commerce company.  
Using **SQL for data modeling & analytics** and **Power BI for visualization**, we uncovered key retention issues, customer value insights, and actionable strategies to reduce churn and broaden the revenue base.

---

## 2. Business Motivation  
Despite generating **₹123M+ revenue**, the business faced critical issues:  
- **41% lost customers (RFM analysis)**  
- **Q4 retention rate of 31.69%** (slightly below industry benchmarks of 35–40%)  
- **High dependency on top 20% customers contributing 55% of revenue**  

**Goal:** Identify why customers churn, find revenue concentration risks, and design actionable retention & acquisition strategies.

## 3. Tech Stack  
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, RFM segmentation, Cohort analysis, CLV calculation  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards for executive summary, segmentation, retention trends, and strategic insights  
- **Data:** Synthetic e-commerce dataset (customers, transactions, products)

---

## 4. SQL Key Highlights  
- **RFM Segmentation:** Tagged customers as `Lost`, `At Risk`, `Champions`, `Potential Loyalists`, etc.  
- **CLV Calculation:** Segmented customers into `High`, `Medium`, and `Low CLV`  
- **Pareto Analysis:** Measured revenue dependency on top 20% customers  
- **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked customer retention for 3 months after first purchase  

**SQL file:** [`ecommerce_customer_insights.sql`](./ecommerce_customer_insights.sql)

## 5. Dashboard Highlights  

### Executive Summary Dashboard  
- **₹123.28M revenue**, **19K orders**, **5K customers**  
- **Q4 retention rate:** 31.69% (below benchmark)  
- **Top 20% customers:** 55% revenue dependency  
- **Lost segment:** 60.7% revenue  

### RFM & CLV Dashboard  
- **41.58% customers lost**  
- **High CLV customers:** 33.92%  
- **Top 10 high CLV customers → 7 are Lost (critical risk)**  
- **Gujarat → lowest CLV**, **Tripura → highest high CLV concentration**  
- **January 2024 acquisition dip** detected  

### Customer Segmentation & Retention Dashboard  
- **Age 50+ & 36–50 segments → 70% revenue**  
- **18–25 age group → only 15.8% revenue share** (low engagement)  
- **High churn states:** West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Rajasthan (>45% lost)  
- **At-Risk states:** Assam, Telangana, Punjab, Kerala (18–20% at risk)  

### Insight Reports & Strategic Recommendations  
**Key Problems Identified:**  
- High churn (41%) & low retention (31.69%)  
- Heavy revenue dependency on top 20% customers (55%)  
- Poor younger customer engagement (18–25)  
- Region-specific CLV issues (Gujarat low CLV)  
- January 2024 acquisition dip  

**Strategic Actions:**  
- **State & age-specific retention campaigns** → “We Miss You” WhatsApp & email reactivation offers  
- **Onboarding redesign** → gamified push notifications, post-purchase referral rewards, in-app onboarding checklist  
- **Subscription pilot & bundle deals** for repeat-purchase products  
- **Targeted acquisition shift** → Instagram micro-influencers + student discounts (5%) for younger audience  

**KPIs post-action:**  
- Retention rate → **40%+**  
- Lost customers → **<30%**  
- Top 20% revenue share → **<50%**  
- 18–25 age revenue share → **20%+**
